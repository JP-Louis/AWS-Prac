Steps to make docker instances run on ECS
1. Create an ECS cluster
2. Launch EC2 instances
3. Install and configure ECS agent on EC2 instances
4. Create task definition
5. Create a service

Create ECS
1. Choose Network Only 
2. Give a name to the cluster
    1. do not select the VPC option

Create an IAM Role
1. Choose “Elastic Container Service”
2. Choose “EC2 Role for Elastic Container Service”
Create an EC2 instance(use t2.small due to small memory)
1. From community AMI use an instance that has ECS agent and Docker installed —> ex :amzn-ami-2018.03.e-amazon-ecs-optimized - ami-00129b193dc81bc31
2. User Data
        #!/bin/bash
        echo ECS_CLUSTER=[ECSClusterName] >> /etc/ecs/ecs.config
3. Above user data should make the EC2 instance register with ECS cluster
4. Make sure that you use proper IAM role for these instances


Create a docker registry 
1. go to was ECS menu and choose “repositories”
2. Create a repo and run following commands to build, tag and push the image
    1. $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-1)
    2. docker build -t gcit . 
    3. docker tag lms:latest 985863529922.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lms:latest
    4. docker push 985863529922.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/lms:latest


Create a task Definition 
1. Select task role as “none”
2. Network mode “bridge” (This is similar to default because default for linux is bridge)
3. Add container
    1. Provide hard limit 512 
    2. Only assign port for the container and keep the host port as blank (ECS will assign random ports for you)
    3.  Press create


Create a service 
1. Go to your ECS cluster and click on create service
2. provide a service name
3. number of tasks should be 2 
4. leave everything else as default and click next
5. Choose Application Load balancer
6. Click “Add to Load Balancer” under container to load balancer (Make sure that listener is already existing)
    1. Provide port 8090
    2. Leave everything else as default 
7. Click next to create the service
