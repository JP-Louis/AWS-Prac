1. Study all of the families of Images and what each one is best at/use case

EC2 Instance Types

General Purpose - Provides a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads.
These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources in equal proportions such as web servers and code repositories.
Mac, T4g, T3, T3a, T2, M6g, M5, M5a, M5n, M5zn, M4, A1

Compute Optimized - Ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors.
Instances belonging to this family are well suited for batch processing workloads, media transcoding, high performance web servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers and ad server engines, machine learning interface and other compute intensive applications.
C6g, C6gn, C5, C5a, C5n, C4

Memory Optimized - Designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
R6g, R5, R5a, R5b, R5n, R4, X2gd, X1e, X1, High Memory, z1d

Accelerated Computing - Used for hardware accelerators, or co-processors, to perform functions such as floating point number calculations,
graphics processing, or data pattern matching, more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs
P4, P3, P2, Inf1, G4dn, G4ad, G3, F1

Storage Optimized - Designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.
They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications
I3, I3en, D2, D3, D3en, H1
